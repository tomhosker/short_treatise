The overwhelming majority of Honey Monsters belong to the Honey Monster Apostolic Church, which was founded by St Gregory the Inseminator - so called for his seminal translations of the gospels into Middle Honeymonsterese - in the eighth century after Christ. Said church maintains the ancient three-fold structure of the clergy - bishops, priests and beekeepers - as well as all the other doctrines and traditions passed down from the apostles and the church fathers. In terms of distinctive teachings: great prominence is given to Samson, especially for his riddle to the Philistines, 'Out of the strong came forth sweetness'; St Paul and his writings, on the other hand, are strongly de-emphasised, owing to a notorious maxim from his first epistle to Timothy, 'The love of honey is the root of all evil.'
